# Seekee: free alternative to watch movies and series

In a previous post I talked about
[Stremio and Torrentio](/en/blog/2024/la-mejor-alternativa-gratis-a-netflix.md)
as the best free alternative to Netflix, and I still think it's an excellent
option, especially on a computer or Android TV. However, today I want to talk
about **Seekee**, an alternative that has surprised me with its ease of use and
its extensive content catalog.

## What is Seekee?

[Seekee](https://seekee.app/) is a free mobile app that lets you watch movies
and series from different streaming platforms without subscriptions. Its
approach is simple: search for content, select it, and play it directly from the
app.

## How to install it?

Seekee is available as an Android app. You can install it directly from the
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enzo.paulo) or
download the APK from their [website](https://seekee.app/).

## Advantages of Seekee

- **Large content catalog**: Seekee aggregates content from multiple sources,
  making it easy to find what you want to watch. Unlike Stremio with Torrentio,
  where availability depends on torrents with seeders, Seekee makes it much
  more straightforward.
- **Simple interface**: No need to configure extensions, providers, or worry
  about seeders. Just search and play.
- **Free**: No subscription or payment required.

## WiFi transfer to Smart TV

Seekee allows you to transfer playback to your Smart TV via WiFi. However, let's
be honest: **the transfer quality is low to medium**. If you're particular about
resolution, this could be a downside. For casual viewing or when you don't have
another option, it works, but don't expect Full HD quality on the big screen.

## Seekee vs Stremio: which one to choose?

| Feature         | Seekee                                    | Stremio + Torrentio               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Platforms       | Android (mobile)                          | Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, Web |
| Content catalog | Large, multiple sources                   | Depends on available torrents     |
| Video quality   | Good on mobile, low/medium on TV via WiFi | Depends on seeders, can be high   |
| Setup           | Minimal, ready to use                     | Requires configuring extensions   |
| TV transfer     | WiFi (limited quality)                    | Native Android TV, HDMI cable     |
| Subtitles       | Included depending on source              | OpenSubtitles extensions          |

### When to use each one?

- **Use Seekee** if you mainly watch content on your phone, want a hassle-free
  experience, and don't mind sacrificing quality when casting to TV.
- **Use Stremio** if you want to watch content on your computer or Android TV
  with better quality and don't mind configuring extensions.

Personally, I think both complement each other. Seekee is ideal for quick mobile
viewing with minimal setup, while Stremio remains the best option for a more
complete experience on the big screen.
