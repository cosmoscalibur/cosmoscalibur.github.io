# Free AI Tools for Developers in 2026

We are in 2026 and artificial intelligence is no longer a novelty, it is the
standard. However, the bottleneck remains the same for many independent
developers and students: the cost of subscriptions. Maintaining access to
frontier models can easily amount to hundreds of dollars a month.

Luckily, the fierce competition between big tech and the open source community
has gifted us an ecosystem where it is possible to access cutting-edge tools for
free. This is my analysis of the definitive free AI *stack* for this year.

## Antigravity: Google Deepmind's Bet

[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/download) has quickly become the
must-have development environment for those of us working close to the Google
ecosystem. What makes it irresistible is not just its deep integration, but its
generous free quota on frontier models.

Its integration is deep. On one hand, the browser extension allows controlling
the browser, inspecting the console, taking screenshots and analyzing the site,
facilitating not just implementation but also management.

On the other hand, and more relevant to the workflow, is its handling of
artifacts. Antigravity generates documents with the implementation plan where
comments can be made directly, improving feedback with the agent before starting
to code. upon completion, it produces a summary of the work. **It is crucial to
read this summary carefully, as it often contains warnings about pending
tasks.**

Antigravity offers daily free access to **Gemini 3 Pro** and **Gemini 3 Flash**.
But what really surprises is the inclusion of third-party models: you have
limited but functional access to Claude **Sonnet** and **Opus** (from Anthropic)
at no additional cost. It is perfect for those of us who need to contrast
solutions between models with different reasoning styles, but also for those who
identify strengths in models and want to use them according to the tasks. In my
case, I have identified the following:

- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Direct code implementation with clear definitions and
  architecture on my part. To the extent that the specification is clearer, I
  consider Sonnet's implementation level better than the code generated by
  Gemini.
- Gemini 3 Flash: Code implementation in which I require greater support for
  definition and research from the model, searching external sources. It has a
  good balance of quality and speed, and potentially lower token consumption
  than Sonnet.
- Gemini 3 Pro: Elaboration of implementation plans, research of external
  sources, code understanding and documentation elaboration.

I do not usually use Claude Opus 4.5 (_thinking_) for its high token consumption
compared to the benefit I get with Sonnet (with whom it shares the quota).
Identifying strengths is a way to take advantage of independent token quotas
instead of using a model until its quota is exhausted to only then switch to
another.

It is important to properly use the _planning_ mode for the elaboration of
complex tasks or those requiring research or better planning, in contrast to the
_fast_ mode for simple tasks and where we can give clearer specification and
only require implementation help (somehow, what we would be able to set up
without difficulty, but need speed). This helps optimize token usage and make
better use of quotas. Currently the free quota renews weekly.

Important, to help better direct tasks, the use of rules and skills is
recommended, which help define the general behavior of the agent (_agent rules_)
and the way to execute specific tasks (_agent skills_, which is a standard,
although its route definition is not).

### Ampcode: Free Opus (with a twist)

If the Opus quota in Antigravity falls short for you, AmpCode is the solution.
Through ad-based funding (yes, ads in your IDE, but surprisingly non-invasive),
Ampcode allows you to use **Opus** 4.5 for code elaboration and **GPT** 5.2 for
planning and external search work (the Oracle) in a predefined way in the
_smart_ mode (the definition of what each model is better for), and fast models
with lower token consumption (and less capable) for simpler tasks with the
_rush_ mode. Unlike Antigravity, in Ampcode it is better to have a prior
planning process (even with agent help, but indicating not to implement code,
just do planning) and then manually partition tasks. This way we can have
greater control over execution, as I have observed it tends to be highly
autonomous, but at the cost of some deviations from the initial objective if
open points remain that it must infer, which in the Antigravity flow is less
common due to the integration of explicit planning.

[AmpCode](https://ampcode.com/install) is available as CLI and extension (for
example, available for VSCode/Antigravity)

## Zed: The ultra-fast editor continues to reign

[Zed](../2025/zed-un-editor-rapido-y-moderno-de-codigo-abierto.md) continues to
be my go-to editor for its absurd speed, continuous development, native AI
integration, debugging protocol, git integration and its growing ecosystem of
extensions.

Basically, Zed natively integrates **Gemini** through its ACP protocol (first
integrated agent), and with the Google account you have access to the Gemini
family of models (determined by the CLI accessed). It is important that this
quota can be affected by general Google AI usage (i.e., your usage in Zed,
Antigravity, Gemini).

### Opencode: Open source agents

[Opencode](https://opencode.ai/download) is an *open source* agent solution
available as CLI, desktop application and extension for multiple IDEs (available
not just in Zed, also for VSCode/Antigravity). It has a unified interface for
multiple models with free quota (temporarily, while these models collect
information and make improvements), as well as compatibility for connection with
many more providers. It distinguishes the planning (*plan*) and implementation
(*build*) modes explicitly. Regarding the models with free quota currently:

- **Grok Code Fast 1**: Fast and economical model from xAI, focused on code. It
  is found available for free in some editors and announced as limited time.
- **GPT-5 Nano**: Fast and economical model from OpenAI. Good for simple tasks,
  mainly text, but in simple code it can be a good option.
- **MiniMax M2.1** and **GLM-4.7**: Excellent *open source* options available
  with free quota. So far I haven't advanced much in this exploration, but GLM
  has generated more confidence in me, although its reasoning is good, in
  several cases it has gotten stuck in generation. And with MiniMax language
  mixes have occurred (texts in Spanish and Chinese at the same time).

### Text Mode in Zed

My favorite workflow currently is using **Text Mode** in Zed. I combine the
agility of *Github Copilot* (in its free tier for *Open Source* maintainers) for
line-by-line suggestions, with **Gemini** in the side panel for architecture
queries. Latency is low and the writing experience is fluid, without the visual
overload of other IDEs.

## Local Models: Privacy and power in your team

We cannot talk about a free *stack* without mentioning local execution. With
current *hardware*, running quantized models is viable even on mid-range
laptops.

Using [{program}`ollama`](../2025/instala-tu-asistente-local-de-ia.md), my local
configuration includes:

- `gemma3n:e4b`: The nano version of Gemma 3. Incredibly efficient for simple
  tasks and grammar correction, only in text mode.
- `qwen3:8b`: The king of local reasoning. Its logical capacity rivals closed
  models of 2025. Available in *zed agent*.
- `qwen2.5-code:7b`: A classic that remains valid, specific for code. Available
  in *zed agent*.

It is important to highlight that Zed agent (*zed agent*) discovers available
models, through subscription or locals like ollama that you must install
previously. Ensure the *Ask* permission mode if you want greater control, or
*Write* to allow default modifications.

## Conclusion

In 2026, you don't need to pay a fortune to code with superpowers. Combining the
raw power of **Antigravity** and its extensions like **Ampcode**, with the speed
of **Zed** vitaminized by **Gemini**, **Opencode**, and backed by local models
in **Ollama**, you have a world-class development environment at zero cost.

Analyze which tools adapt to your style, and as always, happy coding!
