# Planetary alignment 2025

We began the year 2025 with a couple of important astronomical events, and one
of these is the planetary alignment. The other event is the maximum brightness
of what has been called the comet of the century, C/2024 G3 (ATLAS), but let's
talk about the planetary alignment.

## What is a planetary alignment?

Planetary alignments are just a curiosity in the planetary configuration in the
Solar System that allows for the observation of several planets at the same time
if we know where to look and how to observe them.

It is not an unusual or scientifically significant event, but it is a special
opportunity for amateurs and sky watchers. The alignment occurs because more
than one planet is found on the same side of the sun, although it does not
necessarily form a straight line.

## Which Planets Can Be Seen in the Alignment?

In January 2025, we will have the opportunity to observe Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all in one night. We almost have the complete set,
as the only planet missing is Mercury (and let's not forget that Pluto has not
been considered a planet since 2006).

An important detail with this is that Uranus and Neptune have very low
brightness, making their observation in the night sky difficult (they are at the
limit of visibility to the naked eye) and even more so in urban areas with light
pollution. So, you will need binoculars or a telescope to observe them.

February will bring a surprise as Mercury will join the lineup near the end of
the month, although this planet's proximity to the Sun makes it challenging to
observe.

You can explore the planetary configuration using
[Eyes on the solar system](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/mercury?time=2025-02-28T12:30:00.031+00:00&rate=0)
to understand how they appear in their orbits at these moments.

## How to Observe the Planets During the Planetary Alignment?

To start, we will have the opportunity to observe Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn with the naked eye (no optical aid needed). What we need now is to know
where to look.

Before I tell you this, there are tools and websites that can help you with
this:

- [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/) offers a web
  application to check planetary visibility based on your detected location.
- [Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/) has a web version that you can use
  without installation. If you prefer, you can install it on your
  [computer](/en/blog/2024/que-hacer-despues-de-instalar-manjaro.md#now-look-at-the-sky)
  or
  [mobile device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noctuasoftware.stellarium_free).

```{important}
The time information provided below corresponds to Medellín, Colombia. In my case, I went out to observe the sky at 7 P.M., before the mountains affect visibility near the horizon.
```

Venus and Saturn are quite close to each other, in the constellation Aquarius,
toward the west. They will be visible until 9:14 P.M. on the horizon, but keep
in mind that due to the presence of buildings or mountains, this visibility will
be a bit earlier. Venus will be the brightest point, and Saturn a slightly
dimmer point above it. If you use a telescope, you can observe Neptune slightly
above Venus, in the constellation Pisces.

```{hint}
You distinguish a planet from a star because the brightness of stars seems to vary continuously, *twinkle*, while the brightness of planets is constant.
```

Jupiter will be near the highest point in the sky, toward the east, in the
constellation Taurus. It will be the brightest point in this area, and remember
that planets do not twinkle (increase or decrease their brightness); they appear
constant. If you continue looking down toward the east, about halfway, you will
see a constantly shining and reddish point, which is Mars. I emphasize again the
constant brightness because along your visual path, you will find a bright red
point near Jupiter, which is the star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus, and
slightly below it, the star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion. With
binoculars, you can look for Uranus, which is very close to Jupiter in the
western direction, in the constellation Aries.
